### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the TerrorByteTW organization, created by [Nate Reprogle](https://github.com/TerrrorByte). This primarily serves as a way to separate my personal repos from my "production" ones, or ones that I create specifically for public use.

## My work

The "flagship" project in this org is Honeypot, an anti-grief plugin designed to help catch griefers. I develop it for fun, but people actually use it, which is kinda cool! Check out some stats below on it
